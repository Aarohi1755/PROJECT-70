The Junior School celebrated the International Yoga Day with great gusto on 21 June 2021. The students of all classes UKG-V participated in a special virtual yoga session with their class teachers early morning, much before their online classes. Together they did breathing exercises, neck exercises and some simple asanas for general well being. 

Yoga, as is a known fact, not only improves overall fitness but also helps to retain body flexibility, increases immunity, keeps the heart, respiratory and digestive systems fit, improves body posture and increases attention span and concentration. The teachers discussed the benefits of yoga with the children and encouraged them to make it an integral part of their life style. Children promised to practice yoga regularly and impressed everyone with their yoga postures.  </h4>

The one-hour long session was led by Ms Harneet Kaur Gujral, B.A. Mathematics Honours, Mathematics Subject Matter Expert.

The session aimed at boosting mathematical powers with Vedic Maths. It addressed the phobia that children have for maths encouraging them to do quick mental calculations in a game format unfolding the magic of Vedic maths. The children learnt as they played. The energy during the entire session was palpable as the children vied with each other to be the first to solve questions or post queries.

They learnt quick rules to add, subtract and multiply big figures.

All in all it was a fruitful, interactive session.</h4>
